# 🧠 Mental Health & Lifestyle — Data Analysis & Predictive Modeling

This project analyzes the relationship between lifestyle factors and mental health conditions, and builds predictive Machine Learning models to identify individuals who may be at higher risk. The goal is to explore patterns, evaluate key contributing features, and support data-driven mental health awareness.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Mental health issues are influenced by lifestyle, habits, and environmental factors. By analyzing behavioral and personal attributes, we aim to:

- Identify key lifestyle patterns affecting mental health.
- Develop models that predict mental health risk.
- Provide insights to support early understanding and awareness.

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Lifestyle choices (sleep, stress level, physical activity) show significant correlation with mental well-being.
- Certain personal routines act as strong predictors in classification models.
- Balanced sleep patterns and stress coping strategies can play a major role in reducing risk.
